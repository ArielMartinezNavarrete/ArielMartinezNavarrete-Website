        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sales RepresentativeðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a junior undergraduate student who is currently attending the University of California in Riverside and am majoring in psychology. As a third-year student, I am also a transfer student from San Bernardino Community College along with having had previously attended Riverside Community College and Moreno Valley Community College. I have even attended a technical school in Riverside called Riverside's School of Career Education for about nine months in order to become a Registered Dental Assistant which required me to take a state exam that I ended up failing and not attempting to take again. I also ended up working at a children's dental clinic for almost a year and quit because I wanted to go back to school to obtain my bachelor's degree in psychology instead since I was only earning minimum wage working as a full-time dental assistant. I am currently living in Rialto, California with my significant other along with his family and have been with him for over four years now which is also almost four since I have moved out of my parentâ€™s house which my family still resides there in Moreno Valley, California.<br><br>

        I have not only just been attending school and working at a dental clinic in my past but have also worked at other jobs as well. My first job I had was at Superior Grocers in Moreno Valley for around a month or two, California in 2013 which was the year I graduated high school and I had started working a few months after I had finished and graduated high school. This was also around the time I had attended Cal State San Bernardino for the summer just to fulfill a math requirement before going to their school even though in the end I didn't attend that university due to my FAFSA being received late by the school and myself not being able to afford attending a university, so I decided to apply and attend to Moreno Valley college the following semester to come which was spring of 2014. My other jobs I have worked at around the time I was attending college was Edible Arrangements which I started out as a seasonal job and then got hired for a part-time job and I only stayed with the company for around three to four months because of the harassment along with the verbal and physical abuse I was receiving from my manager at the time on top of having a few customers get upset with me and overall have stress in the workplace.<br><br>

        I am so happy I left and just miss being able to eat the chocolate covered fruits there, especially the apple truffles which were my favorite. A year before that job, I had worked a seasonal job as a Bell Ringer for the Salvation Army for about a month around Christmas time standing in the cold as I was ringing a bell and sometime holding doors for people and saying Merry Christmas or even Happy Holidays which also had it's bad moments where the Macy's manager where I was being a bell ringer for got upset with me for holding doors to people because of a possibility of a robber escaping easily, plus, some people would get upset with me if I said Merry Christmas to them if they did not celebrate Christmas or get upset if I said Happy Holidays to them because they thought I was profiling their appearance and thinking they believed in another religion that was not involved with Christianity. I kind of don't like people much anymore because of all the things I've been through, but that's life and I just have to learn to deal with it, with the torment and mean people. I have also worked at AutoZone for almost two years in customer service and also as a parts delivery driver which was cool but was tough at times too since I had to carry a lot of heavy parts that I should not having been lifting like car batteries or brake discs, or even tires but those were usually lifted by workers of the tire shops I would go to at times along with the mechanic shops I would deliver to.
